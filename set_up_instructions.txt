Instructions

1. Extract all the files from the zip file. The content is listed below.

- set_up_instructions.txt  -- contains the set up instructions
- requirements.txt   -- contains the list of packages with the right version numbers used
- diabetes.csv  -- contains the original dataset
- processed_diabetes.csv  -- contains the processed dataset
- Diabetes-Preprocessing.ipynb  -- contains the codes for data preprocessing in a Jupyter notebook
- best_mlp.pkl  -- best Multilayer Perceptron model
- best_svm.sav  -- best Support Vector Machine model
- Diabetes-Modelling-Final.ipynb  -- contains the codes for training and testing models
- Bona_Chow_Diabetes_Report.pdf  -- contains the research paper

2. Change directory to the extracted folder, and save any test data into this root folder.

3. Create a new virtual environment and install jupyterlab and packages listed in requirements.txt. 

In command lines:
$ conda create –n test_env
$ conda activate test_env
$ cd BC_NCsubmission
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

4. To load the dataset and required libraries before testing the models, run the cells in “Diabetes-Modelling-Final.ipynb” from the beginning up to just before the section “Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model”. Then, to test the models, run the cells in the “Evaluate best SVM and MLP models” section at the end.
