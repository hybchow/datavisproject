# A comparative study in Diabetes Diagnosis through Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine
Bona Chow

Abstract
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms yielded similar test AUCs and accuracies on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. MLPâ€™s higher specificity of 89% compared to SVM (78%) makes MLP more suitable for practical use, as there is a high cost associated with the incorrect classification of a large number of non-diabetes patients.
