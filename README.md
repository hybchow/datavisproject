# A comparative study in Diabetes Diagnosis through Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine


## Summary

Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes are essential to avoid complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. In this work, we compared and critically evaluated the use of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to aid the diagnosis of diabetes using the [Pima Indian Diabetes database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). PyTorch and Scikit-learn packages were used to build the models. 

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms yielded similar test AUCs and accuracies on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. MLPâ€™s higher specificity of 89% compared to SVM (78%) makes MLP more suitable for practical use, as there is a high cost associated with the incorrect classification of a large number of non-diabetes patients.
